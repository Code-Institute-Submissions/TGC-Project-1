### TGC - User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project 1 ###
By: **Collin Wu Yuewei** -- *Code Institude Batch 8* -- 

A user-centric portfolio website to promote a movement therapist's skills, knowledge and services. The website has strategic information highlighted to allow the user to make an informed decision to engage the therapist. Using colourful and striking interactive buttons and pop-ups that provide feedback to the user as well as full viewport 5-page single website modern design to remove link loading time resulting in faster response time.

## Aim ##
The goal of the project is to build a static front-end site to present useful information to users, using techonology and languages taught in the Code Institute Fullstack Web Developer Program; at Project 1, namely HTML and CSS.

The concept chosen for this project is Functional Integration Center Website -- *[Feldenkrais-Asia](http://feldenkrais-asia.com/)* -- which is a old wordpress portfilo website that is not mobile responsive (created by me), and upgrade it to a modern mobile responsive website to present information of the movement therapist with information on the techniques and services provided which then can direct potential customers to the therapist.

## UX ##

The target audience for this website are for people whom are of the working class and older that are in search of pain-relief or mobility-aid as well as atheletes looking to improve their flexibility and performance.

This project was a mobile first and a single hand operation design in mind. It has to fill the screen and have sufficiently large fonts for pleasant viewing.

The navigation bar is a large sidebar that expands from the left with a collapse button to the bottom left, so that it is easily access via the thumb of the user.

All buttons are purposefully place nearer to the lower left bottom of each page for easy thumb access. Large call to action buttons have color change feedback on press; to quickly gain access to pop-ups with information or relocation to another page down the website.

On larger devices, more fanciful hover animations and color-change is implemented for better user feedback. Most button are now centered for symmmetry. 

The theme of the website is darker, earthy colors with contrasting bright orange and yellow to provide a inviting and theraputic association.

The 100% viewport pages design are meant for focusing the user, to focus on a full screen as a page and not be distracted by half/cut-off pages; in which can either be scrolled through or brought to with the navbar.



Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
