## Aim ##
The goal of the project is to build a static front-end site to present useful information to users, using techonology and languages taught in the Code Institute Fullstack Web Developer Program; at Project 1, namely HTML and CSS.

The concept chosen for this project is Functional Integration Center Website -- *[Feldenkrais-Asia](http://feldenkrais-asia.com/)* -- which is a old wordpress portfilo website that is not mobile responsive (created by me), and upgrade it to a modern mobile responsive website to present information of the movement therapist with information on the techniques and services provided which then can direct potential customers to the therapist.

## UX ##

The target audience for this website are for people whom are of the working class and older that are in search of pain-relief or mobility-aid as well as atheletes looking to improve their flexibility and performance.

This project was a mobile first and a single hand operation design in mind. It has to fill the screen and have sufficiently large fonts for pleasant viewing.

The navigation bar is a large sidebar that expands from the left with a collapse button to the bottom left, so that it is easily access via the thumb of the user.

All buttons are purposefully place nearer to the lower left bottom of each page for easy thumb access. Large call to action buttons have color change feedback on press; to quickly gain access to pop-ups with information or relocation to another page down the website.

On larger devices, more fanciful hover animations and color-change is implemented for better user feedback. Most button are now centered for symmmetry. 

The theme of the website is darker, earthy colors with contrasting bright orange and yellow to provide a inviting and theraputic association.

## Testing ##

#### Responsiveness ####
The webpage was manual tested for responsiveness on physical iPhone 6S, Samsung S8+, Xiaomi Mi Max2, 1920 x 1080 laptop screen.

Other devices that are not available physically were tested using this following [Responsiveness Tool](http://responsivetesttool.com/) webpage, [Mobile-Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=07L3WeU_nndVYwaUTleP7w) as well as [Am I Responsive Design](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/?url=https://collinwuy.github.io/TGC-Project-1/)

![Mobile-Friendly Test Results](assets/images/mobile-friendly-test.png "Mobile-Friendly Test Results")

All platforms had to have correct CSS design, working animation, buttons, pop-up and elements placed in the correct position.

#### Page Load Time ####

The page load time is tested using [Pingdom Tool](https://tools.pingdom.com/) while being hosted by GitHub Pages. This is vital and important as the goal was to have a responsive, non-laggy webpage with no link-loading from page to page, achieving an __A__ rating of __91/100__ points also on Asia, America and European Servers.

#### Code Validation ####

Code validation is achieve by using developer tools provided by [W3C Developer Tools](https://w3c.github.io/developers/tools/). The webpage code tested til no errors are found on their [Nu Html Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcollinwuy.github.io%2FTGC-Project-1%2F), [Internationlization Validator](https://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/check?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fcollinwuy.github.io%2FTGC-Project-1%2F#validate-by-uri+), [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fcollinwuy.github.io%2FTGC-Project-1%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en), [Link Validator](https://validator.w3.org/checklink?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fcollinwuy.github.io%2FTGC-Project-1%2F&summary=on&hide_type=all&depth=&check=Check).

#### Manual Testing ####

Other testing include:
- Testing of button a tag links, ensuring they jump to the correct part of the page
- Hover animation testing with laptop and mouse overs
- Accordion testing, ensuring pop-up panel happens on click
- Social button's linking to Call on mobile, new page for facebook and re-direct to email with email button
- Contact form testing
  - Error pop-up alert for not having required fields
  - Email format is correct before able to submit
  - Ensuring JavaScript is active, allowing only 1 checkbox to be selected at a time
  - Proper Error Pop-up if form validation has an error
  - Proper Success Pop-up if form submit and validation is successful

#### Browser Testing ####

The site while being hosted by Github Pages is tested on a laptop of 1920x1080 resolution:
- Brave
- Google Chrome
- Firefox
- Microsoft Edge

It is also tested on a iPhone 6S for:
- Safari 

#### Bugs ####

Currently as the mobile responsiveness is accomplished by purely CSS, different vertically of different device viewports causes shifting of the format of the webpage, or having the fonts becoming too small for that viewport. I think this can be resolve if the html is convertered into BootStrap for more unified resizing as compared to media queries.

On certain browsers, like Safari, JavaScript may not function on old versions of Safari and Firefox Browsers have issue reading CSS for checkboxes. However based on [W3School Browser Statics](https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/) in 2020, 80%+ uses Chrome, small number of people uses other browsers.
